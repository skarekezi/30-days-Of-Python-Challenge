🐍 30 Days of Python
📚 Overview

This repository represents my 30 Days of Python project, following the challenge provided by Asabeneh. The project covers Python basic and advanced topics, including data handling, object-oriented programming, file operations, error handling, statistics, Pandas, Matplotlib visualizations, API simulations, and virtual environment concepts. All examples are designed to be offline-friendly, allowing easy practice of Python concepts without requiring internet access.

📁 Project Structure

The repository is broken down into 30 individual scripts or notebooks, each representing one day of learning:

Days 1–10: Basics of Python — variables, operators, strings, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, conditionals, loops, and functions.

Days 11–15: Functions, modules, list comprehensions, higher-order functions, and Python type errors.

Days 16–20: Date and time handling, exception handling, regular expressions, file operations, and Python package management.

Days 21–25: Object-oriented programming, web scraping simulations, virtual environment simulations, statistics, and Pandas for data analysis and visualization.

Days 26–30: Python web interactions, MongoDB simulations, creation and consumption of APIs, building offline APIs, and final summaries with visualizations.

⚙️ How to Explore This Project

Each day is organized into its own file for clarity and ease of use. 📄

The project is designed to run offline, with simulated examples for API calls, web scraping, and virtual environments. 🌐❌

Several days include graphs and visualizations to help understand data and Python operations. 📊

Users can adapt the examples to analyze their own data and practice Python interactively. ✨

This repository covers both foundational and applied Python concepts, making it suitable for beginners and learners who want to strengthen their programming skills. 🎓
