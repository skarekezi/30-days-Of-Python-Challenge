30 Days of Python Challenge


This repository contains my 30 Days of Python project, following the challenge by Asabeneh. The project covers Python fundamentals to advanced concepts, including data handling, object-oriented programming, file operations, error handling, statistics, Pandas, Matplotlib visualizations, API simulations, and virtual environments. All examples are designed to be offline-friendly, making it easy to practice Python concepts without requiring an internet connection.

Project Structure

The repository is organized into 30 separate scripts or notebooks, each representing a day of learning:

Days 1–10: Basics of Python, including variables, operators, strings, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, conditionals, loops, and functions.

Days 11–15: Functions, modules, list comprehensions, higher-order functions, and Python type errors.

Days 16–20: Date and time handling, exception handling, regular expressions, file operations, and Python package management.

Days 21–25: Object-oriented programming, web scraping simulations, virtual environment simulations, statistics, and Pandas for data analysis and visualization.

Days 26–30: Python web interactions, MongoDB simulations, API creation and consumption, building offline APIs, and final summaries with visualizations.

How to Explore This Project

Each day is organized into its own file for clarity and ease of use.

The code is designed to run offline, with simulated examples for API calls, web scraping, and virtual environments.

Several days include graphs and visualizations to better understand data and Python operations.

Users can modify the examples to explore their own data and practice Python interactively.

The repository demonstrates both fundamental Python concepts and practical applications, making it suitable for beginners as well as those looking to strengthen their programming skills.

Key Features

Comprehensive coverage of 30 days of Python learning.

Offline-ready examples, eliminating the need for internet access.

Simulated API and web scraping exercises for practical understanding.

Data visualization using Matplotlib, including bar charts, pie charts, and other graphs.

Demonstration of Python best practices including object-oriented programming, modular coding, and exception handling.

Suitable for learners who want a structured path from basic Python to advanced applications.
