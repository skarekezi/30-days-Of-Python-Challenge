30 DAYS of PythoN
📚 Overview

This repository contains my 30 Days of Python project, following the challenge by Asabeneh. The project covers Python fundamentals to advanced concepts, including data handling, object-oriented programming, file operations, error handling, statistics, Pandas, Matplotlib visualizations, API simulations, and virtual environments. All examples are designed to be offline-friendly, making it easy to practice Python concepts without requiring an internet connection.

🗂 Project Structure

The repository is organized into 30 separate scripts or notebooks, each representing a day of learning:

Days 1–10: Basics of Python, including variables, operators, strings, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, conditionals, loops, and functions.

Days 11–15: Functions, modules, list comprehensions, higher-order functions, and Python type errors.

Days 16–20: Date and time handling, exception handling, regular expressions, file operations, and Python package management.

Days 21–25: Object-oriented programming, web scraping simulations, virtual environment simulations, statistics, and Pandas for data analysis and visualization.

Days 26–30: Python web interactions, MongoDB simulations, API creation and consumption, building offline APIs, and final summaries with visualizations.

⚙️ How to Explore This Project

Each day is organized into its own file for clarity and ease of use. 📄

The code is designed to run offline, with simulated examples for API calls, web scraping, and virtual environments. 🌐❌

Several days include graphs and visualizations to better understand data and Python operations. 📊

Users can modify the examples to explore their own data and practice Python interactively. ✨

The repository demonstrates both fundamental Python concepts and practical applications, making it suitable for beginners as well as those looking to strengthen their programming skills. 💡
